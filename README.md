# QueerConnect SA

QueerConnect SA is a community-driven project supporting LGBTQ+ people across South Asia including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Many platforms focus mainly on Western or Indian queer communities, while people in the rest of the region often face criminalization, stigma, and limited visibility.  
This project aims to create an online space that is safe, accessible, and supportive for anyone in the South Asian queer community.

The goal is to offer:
- A way for people to connect anonymously and safely  
- Access to helpful resources  
- A place to share stories and experiences  
- A simple platform that contributors can expand over time  

This project is part of Winter of Code Social 2025 and is open to contributors of all skill levels.
