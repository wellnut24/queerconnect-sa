# QueerConnect SA 

QueerConnect SA is a **community‑driven, open‑source project** aimed at supporting LGBTQ+ people across **South Asia**, including **India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka**.

While many queer platforms primarily focus on Western or Indian communities, LGBTQ+ individuals across the rest of South Asia often face **criminalization, stigma, safety concerns, and lack of visibility**. QueerConnect SA seeks to bridge this gap by creating a space that is **safe, inclusive, accessible, and culturally aware**.

This project is developed as part of **Winter of Code Social 2025** and is open to contributors of **all skill levels**.
