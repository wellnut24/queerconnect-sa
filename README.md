#QueerConnect SA
A safe, anonymous, digital support network for LGBTQ+ individuals across South Asia.

Overview
QueerConnect SA is an open-source platform designed to support LGBTQ+ individuals in South Asia — including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.
While LGBTQ+ rights vary greatly across the region, many communities still face criminalization, stigma, and isolation. This project aims to create a safe, anonymous, multilingual, community-driven space to connect, learn, and support one another.
This repository is part of Winter of Code Social and welcomes contributors who want to build meaningful social-impact technology.
